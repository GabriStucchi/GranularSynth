# GranularSynth
## Sound Analysis Synthesis and Processing Project

This software is a digital granular synthesizer implemented by our group to achieve independent time-stretching 
and frequency shifting using the [JUCE 
framework](https://juce.com/) and an Hilbert transform implementation took from 
[this software developed by the Harvard-Smithsonian center for astrophysics](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~spaine/am/).

# GranularSynth
## Sound Analysis Synthesis and Processing Project

This software is a digital granular synthesizer implemented by our group to achieve independent time-stretching 
and frequency shifting using the [JUCE 
framework](https://juce.com/) and an Hilbert transform implementation took from 
[this software developed by the Harvard-Smithsonian center for astrophysics](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~spaine/am/). 

# Introduction
Granular synthesis is a synthesis technique based on the construction of a signal 
from a number of short duration acoustic elements called grains with a tipical duration from 5 ms to 100 ms [[2]] [4]. 
This technique was born with the publishment by Dr. Ing. D. Gabor of the article "*Theory of communication*" [[1]] in 
which he, by the use of the [Hilbert Transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_transform) and its meaning in the Quantum Mechanichal Formalism, 
derived a new two-dimensional representation of signals with time and frequency as coordinates which he called "diagram of information".


## Our approach to Gabor's brilliant article and our interpretation of frequency shifting with a parallelism to the quantum mechanical formalism
